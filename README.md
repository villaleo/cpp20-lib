# C++ 20 Library
A library of wrappers, containers, and useful functions. C++ 20 is required, as implementations utilize new features
such as concepts.

## Vec
Created a container, `Vec`. `Vec` is a wrapper over `std::vector` with additional functionality. All the methods from
the `std::vector` class are available, but some have different (more appropriate) names. For more info, see the
`README` in `vec/` directory.
